Instructions for running:

==================
Downloading images
==================
Just run: "python load_data.py" in a python2 environment.
This will create the correct directory structure and download
the necessary images (and do hash checking).

If the images are already downloaded, our directory structure is:

load_images.py
cropped/
   male/
   female/
uncropped/
   male/
   female/


==================
Running the code
==================
There are 5 files, part1.py through part5.py.

Simply run "python tf_faces.py" and everything
should be generated for you.

If you want to test a single part, comment out the 
appropriate lines in tf_faces.py.
